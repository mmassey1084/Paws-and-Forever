## Paws and Forever Adoption Center - Full Website Project

This repository contains a complete front-end website project for **Paws and Forever Adoption Center**, a fictional dog rescue and adoption organization. The site highlights adoptable dogs, the shelter's mission, and provides a fully styled application form to simulate a real user adoption experience. The layout is built using HTML, CSS (Grid and Flexbox), and JavaScript, with added interactivity through form validation, responsive effects, and a countdown timer.
